# RC Car Control System - Lightning MuQueen

This repository hosts the Arduino source code for a remote-controlled car project, including motor management, steering, speed control, and Bluetooth communication. The objective is to enable precise control over the RC car through a custom-built mobile application.

## Features

- Motor control for maneuvering the car in various directions (forward, backward, left, right)
- Speed control through dynamic PWM signal adjustment
- Bluetooth module integration for remote operation via custom mobile app
- Basic error handling

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- Upload the provided Arduino script to your Arduino Uno
- Install and configure the mobile app to communicate with the RC car
